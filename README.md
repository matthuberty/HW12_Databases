# HW12_Databases

# This project was built to demonstrate how javascript can implement SQL (Structured Query Language) to build and maintain a database. 
# The database built is used to store products, their prices, and names.  The datbase is a way in which a company can control and
# manage its inventory.  Managing inventory is critical for many reasons.  For one, too much inventory can cause a company's 
# working capital to be tied up, when it could potentially be put to other good uses.  On the other hand, too little inventory can 
# cause a firm to lose business to competitors, causing the firm to lose brand loyalty and for customers to shop somewhere else. 

# Since many of the transactions are done over the internet today, where people buy and sell goods all of the time, this application
# helps them purchase those products they want and need. 

# Users can get started with the project by invoking the file name after a node command and choosing to purchase a product. They can also
# specify a quantity of items to purchase and see their total after buying.  Further, controls are put in place so that the company selling 
# products doesn't overpromise and commit to selling items that they do not have on hand. 

# Users of the software can get help in using the program by contacting the developer, Matthew J. Huberty at matthew.huberty@gmail.com
